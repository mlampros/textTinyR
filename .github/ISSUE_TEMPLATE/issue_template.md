Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, you also have the option of <https://stackoverflow.com/> (but I'm flexible if it's not too complicated)

Please include a minimal reproducible example

Please give a brief description of the problem

Please add your Operating System (e.g., Windows10, Macintosh, Linux) and the R version that you use (e.g., 3.6.2)

If my package uses Python (via 'reticulate') then please add also the Python version (e.g., Python 3.8) and the 'reticulate' version (e.g., 1.18.0)
